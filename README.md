# Spotify Wrapped in Java ðŸŽ¶

This project replicates a simplified version of the "Spotify Wrapped" feature using Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The program allows users to input their name, premium status, top artist, listening hours, and song streaming data to generate a personalized summary of their top song, artist, and total listening stats.

## Features

- **User Profile**: Collects user information such as name, premium status, and total listening hours.
- **Song Tracking**: Stores each song and its stream count.
- **Top Song Calculation**: Uses a traditional loop-based approach to identify the most-streamed song.
- **Spotify Wrapped Summary**: Provides a custom "Spotify Wrapped" summary with the userâ€™s top song, top artist, total listening hours, and premium status.


This project is perfect for beginners looking to understand Java OOP concepts, user input handling, and data manipulation. ðŸŽ§
